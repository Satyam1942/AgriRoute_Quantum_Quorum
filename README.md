# AgriRoute â€“ Optimized Multi-Stage Agricultural Supply Chain Design

## Overview

AgriRoute is a dynamic web application designed to optimize agricultural supply chains by minimizing costs and spoilage. It addresses challenges such as perishability, transportation constraints, and disruptions. The solution combines a novel optimization algorithm, a dataset generator, performance benchmarking tools, and an interactive visualization dashboard for effective agricultural logistics.

## Features

### 1. **Novel Optimization Algorithm**
- Optimizes routing and resource allocation across farms, hubs, and distribution centers.
- Balances multiple objectives: cost minimization, spoilage reduction, and deadline adherence.
- Considers constraints such as perishability windows.
- Scalable to handle large datasets (e.g., 50 farms, 15 hubs, 10 distribution centers).

### 2. **Simulation and Dataset Generator**
- Generates realistic datasets to simulate agricultural logistics scenarios.
- Supports multiple test scenarios with varying complexity.

### 3. **Algorithm Benchmarking and Performance Analysis**
- Benchmarks the novel algorithm against baseline methods (e.g., greedy heuristics, linear programming).
- Key performance metrics:
  - Total cost (transportation, storage, operational costs).
  - Time and computational efficiency.
- Detailed performance comparisons with visual charts and graphs.

## Key Highlights

- **Innovation**: A novel optimization algorithm specifically designed for multi-stage agricultural supply chains.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and complex logistical scenarios.
- **Dynamic Re-Optimization**: Capable of adjusting routes and allocations in real-time based on disruptions.
